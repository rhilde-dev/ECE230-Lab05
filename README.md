# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.

The role of the Top Level file is to act as the main module that connects all of the switch and led inputs/outputs to the submodules and the submodule input/output to the main top module.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.

The function of the Constraints file is to enable all of the switches, leds, other components on the board, so that they can be used.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?

The selection of Minterm and Maxterm was correct for each circuit. For circuit A, I like how it simplifies for Maxterms but I would rather do minterms because it would give me a simpler equation. For circuit B, I think I would have still done Maxterms because it would have made more grouping and would have simplified less.
