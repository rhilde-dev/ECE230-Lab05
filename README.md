# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.

The role of the Top Level file is to act as the main module that connects all of the switch and led inputs/outputs to the submodules.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.

The function of the Constraints file is to enable all of the switches and leds on the board, so that they can be used.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?

The selection of Minterm and Maxterm was correct for each circuit. (idk what I would have chosen :<)
